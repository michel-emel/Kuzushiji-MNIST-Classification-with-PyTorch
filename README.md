# Kuzushiji-MNIST Classification with PyTorch

## Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying Kuzushiji characters using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch. The CNN model is trained on the Kuzushiji-MNIST (KMNIST) dataset, which includes various characters. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify images into their respective character categories.

## Project Structure
- **KMNIST_Classification.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preparation, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Data Preparation
### Dataset Download
The dataset can be downloaded using the following commands:
```bash
wget http://codh.rois.ac.jp/kmnist/dataset/kmnist/kmnist-train-imgs.npz
wget http://codh.rois.ac.jp/kmnist/dataset/kmnist/kmnist-train-labels.npz
wget http://codh.rois.ac.jp/kmnist/dataset/kmnist/kmnist-test-imgs.npz
wget http://codh.rois.ac.jp/kmnist/dataset/kmnist/kmnist-test-labels.npz
```

### Dataset Splitting
The notebook includes code to split the dataset into training and testing sets.

### Image Augmentation
The `torchvision.transforms` module is used to apply various augmentations such as normalization and random rotations to increase the diversity of the training data.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model is based on the LeNet architecture and includes:
- Convolutional Layers
- Pooling Layers
- Fully-Connected Layers

## Training
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) Loss
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Epochs: 10

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and visualized predictions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following libraries:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Open and run the `KMNIST_Classification.ipynb` notebook
